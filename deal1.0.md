# Introduction

This API has multiple implications including lowering manual entry by making the high-level terms of the deal clear so automated setups can be more easily executed. It also adds transparency into Curated deals that is not currently available in the bid stream.

<a name="goals"></a>
## Goals

- Decrease manual entry of deal information across systems by providing a way for the terms of a deal to be input and sent to the system that will deliver the deal to review and accept.
- Describe what the selling system deal includes at a high level
- Know which parties were involved in curating and selling the package

<a name="what-it-is"></a>
## What it is

- API that provides subscribers with static information about a given Deal that outlines the tenants of the Deal.
- This MVP is a one-party design for the origin system to PUSH information about the deal into the receiving system(s) from the system where it was created (e.g. SSP → DSP). It also allows the same system to query the receiving system for the Deal status after initial deal send. Future versions will likely add support for bi-directional communications.
- Version 1.0 of this API does not support differential overrides

<a name="what-it-isnt"></a>
## What it isn't

- This is a separate API that is **NOT** included in OpenRTB Request/Response
- Does not include real-time information contained in the bid request or determine whether or not a deal applies. Implementers are strongly encouraged to validate the conditions laid out in this deal with OpenRTB requests to ensure their expectations are being met.
- The MVP of this API does NOT support proposals, revisions, or negotiations. It is assumed those are known to implementers *a priori.* Future versions will likely contemplate this functionality.
- The MVP is not meant to support discoverability in deal marketplaces. Future versions may include that functionality.

<a name="considerations"></a>
## Considerations

- The values of these fields are meant to be an outline of business terms agreed to between buyers and sellers *a priori*. The information contained in this API should be used as a guide of what the terms that were agreed to, but they should never be used to bid without validating that information coming from the OpenRTB Bid Request is in line with the terms laid out in this API.
- Deal criteria provided via this channel are not guaranteed to be accurately reflected in bid requests containing the associated deal ID. It is the responsibility of the buyer to validate bid requests that contain the deal ID conform to the deal criteria. In other words, buyers should ALWAYS apply targeting matching the terms outlined in any deal on their side. For example, if a deal is struck for US only inventory, buyers should include that targeting in their DSP when trafficking the campaign.
- If bid requests continually do not match the expectations laid out in the API, a conversation should be had between the buyer and seller to continue negotiations offline.
- It is not possible to validate that the party selling the inventory has been authorized without including app bundle or site id that matches the publishers (app)ads.txt file. Deal IDs receiving requests without that information should be used rarely and closely monitored.

<a name="implementation-guidance"></a>
# Implementation Guidance

<a name="matching-bid-requests-to-deals"></a>
## Matching Bid Requests to Deals

Some level of trust is required when buying any Deal ID. It is incumbent on the buyer of the deal to compare information from the Deal API with information contained in OpenRTB Bid Requests to ensure that it meets their expectations.

Version 1.0 of this API does not support deal revisions. However, some attributes may be subject to change over the flight of the deal. Conversations between implementers should be had around what attributes, if any, may be subject to change after the deal has gone live.

The `deal.id` from both the sender and receiver should match the `deal.id` in the OpenRTB request when bidding. Implementers should use the Deal ID from the Origin system that did the PUSH.

<a name="authorization"></a>
## Authorization

Supply Chain validation should always be done using Object: Supply Chain from OpenRTB. If this information is unavailable, implementers should proceed with extreme caution with the understanding that there is no mechanism to know if a given path is authorized to sell the inventory.

<a name="sending-and-receiving-information"></a>
## Sending and Receiving Information

To send information about a new deal, the origin system will send a PUSH request to the receiving system partner's API endpoint.

Once a deal has been sent by the origin system to the receiving system, it may query the endpoint setup by the reciving system for information about the status of the Deal.  

Implementers may choose to accept incoming webhooks to their API endpoints for events. Please discuss this feature and support with your chosen integration partners.

<a name="deal-object-guidance"></a>
## Deal Object Guidance

<a name="auxiliary-data"></a>
### Auxiliary Data

`auxdata` should be used whenever any non-publisher data is expected to be part of a given deal. This will most often be traditional data providers, but can include optimization services that do NOT belong to the publisher. While the non-publisher data entities are not named, if any company is being paid for their data and/or optimization, this value should indicate the presence of non-publisher data.

This attribute also communicates information about whether or not additional data layers may be applied after the deal has gone live. For example, a deal starts with some additional data and expects the list of data and/or optimization services to be added or updated as the deal is in flight should use a value of 2.

<a name="publisher-count"></a>
### Publisher Count

`pubcount` is meant to communicate if the deal is for a single publishing company, or if it spans multiple publishing companies. Deals covering a single company with multiple web and app properties are considered to be a single publisher. Inventory aggregation services representing multiple publishing sites may also be considered a single publisher deal.

Note that the `pubcount` attribute does **not** contemplate non-publisher parties, including ad tech stacks involved in the transaction. Intermediaries should be identified using Supply Chain Validation from OpenRTB requests.

<a name="dynamic-inventory"></a>
### Dynamic Inventory

`dinventory` communicates information about whether or not the sites and apps included in the initial offering are expected to be updated after the deal goes live. In other words, this attribute communicates the expectation that inventory will (or will not) change by adding or removing sites and/or apps after the deal has gone live. Implementers are strongly encouraged to communicate and discuss the specifics of any and all inventory updates to ensure expectations are met.

<a name="terms-object-1"></a>
## Terms Object

Price attribute must be provided if the deal is a fixed price deal, especially if it's a programmatic guaranteed deal, but otherwise can be used as pricing guidance or not provided at all if there is no pricing guidance (for example, for a Run-of-Exchange deal where there is no pricing guidance)

Where multiple DSP seats are included, per seat acceptance/rejection is on the DSP to surface in their internal systems and User Interfaces.

Examples of Deal name and description so there's a reference point for a standard way of what the fields should contain

<a name="inventory-object-1"></a>
## Inventory Object

This object should only be included when the deal is for a static set of sites or applications (`dinventory=1`).

<a name="included-inventory"></a>
## Included Inventory

This attribute conveys the type of inventory where the deal will run, not the specifics of the inventory itself. Therefore, there is no specific object in OpenRTB that directly relates to this attribute.

For example, `inclinventory.adtype=1,2` means the deal is inclusive of both banner and video ads. Implementers should expect to see ORTB bid requests using either `imp.banner` or `imp.video` once the deal is in flight.

<a name="price-and-floor-guidance"></a>
## Price and Floor Guidance

Historically deals have been negotiated at agreed upon rates to guarantee delivery at a certain price. In the new world many SSPs and curators aggregate media around data points that are not directly related to the inventory itself. Impressions for deals thus curated could have varying price points on a request by request basis. In lieu of a floor provided in these cases, suppliers offer bid guidance that will provide an effective win rate across inventory but do not describe the individual floors of the bid requests included in the deal.

<a name="origin-curator-and-seller"></a>
## Origin, Curator, and Seller

The `origin` attribute refers to the system with the UI where the deal is first input. This will typically be an SSP.

The `curator` attribute names the business entity that did the packaging of inventory, technology and/or data. Most often, although not always, this will be the party that sold the deal to the buyer.

The `seller` attribute represents the business entity who has sourced the demand (aka contracted with the buyer of the deal). When this is NOT either of the entities named in the `origin` or `curator` attributes, this field can be especially valuable.

<a name="example-1"></a>
### Example 1

- SALESHOUSE has the sales team and sources the demand
- The curated deal incorporates data provided by DATA PROVIDER A, DATA PROVIDER B, and potentially DATA PROVIDER C and/or DATA PROVIDER D
- The deal is entered into the SSP
- CURATOR does all the ops to help SALESHOUSE launch the deal

In this case the `seller`=saleshousedomain.com, the `curator`=curatordomain.com, and the `origin`=sspdomain.com

<a name="example-2"></a>
### Example 2

- PUBLISHER has an agreement with DATA PROVIDER A to decorate bid requests and packages the publisher's inventory
- PUBLISHER sources demand for the deal
- PUBLISHER inputs the deal into SSP User interface

In this case the `seller`=publishercompany.com, the `curator`=datacompany.com, and the `origin`=sspdomain.com

<a name="curation-object-1"></a>
## Curation Object

<a name="curation-fee"></a>
### Curation Fee

`curationfee` provides information about the type of fee being applied in the bidstream, but not what that fee is. For example, if a curator is charging a CPM of $5, the `curationfee` will equal 3 because it is a CPM. If a curator is charging a flat fee of $100, the value sent in the `curationfee` attribute will be 2, because it is a flat fee. If the curator is packaging their data alongside the inventory and not taking a specific fee for the Curation service itself, the value will be 4 for no fee.

<a name="example-scenarios"></a>
## Example Scenarios

| Scenario | curationfee | auxdata | pubcount | dinventory |
|----------|:-----------:|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| Publisher packages their O&O inventory and data, and sells a deal to a buyer. No other party is or will be involved in the deal and the inventory will remain static throughout the term of the deal. | 4 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| Data company packages their data across multiple publishers, but does not charge a fee for the specific curation service. Data providers will not be changed, but inventory may be updated after the start of the deal. | 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Curation company charges a CPM fee to aggregate inventory across multiple publishers that they will add and remove as the deal is in flight to optimize deal performance. They have an optimization service, and work with additional data providers to increase addressability, and expect to add additional data partners throughout the flight. | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Curation company works with inventory aggregation company that regularly adds new websites and charges a % of spend to optimize deals. They do not currently work with other data providers, but may layer them in based on deal performance. | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 |
| SSP pays a Curator a CPM to decorate inventory across the SSP universe that they do not pass on to the publishers. All inventory and data is subject to change. | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
